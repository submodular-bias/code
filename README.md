# Code for "Submodular Maximization in the Presence of Bias"

This repository contains the code for reproducing the simulations in our paper "Submodular Maximization in the Presence of Bias."

## Running simulations
1. Run `setup.sh` to download the MovieLens dataset and create the required directory structure
1. To reproduce the simulation with synthetic dataset 1 (Figure 1(a)) run `synthetic-data/synthetic-data-disj.ipynb`
2. To reproduce the simulation with synthetic dataset 2 (Figure 1(b)) run `synthetic-data/synthetic-data-iid.ipynb`
3. To reproduce the simulation with the MovieLens dataset (Figure 2) run `real-world-data/real-world-data.ipynb`
